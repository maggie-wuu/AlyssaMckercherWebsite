                <h3><em>Golden Wallflowers</em></h3>
                <p>When Xander and Harumi unexpectedly reveal that they are dating, they make sure to keep one thing a secret: the fact that their relationship is entirely fake.

    The two couldn’t be more different. Before their announcement, they were barely even friends. While Xander is widely beloved for his kindness, Harumi is avoided for her bluntness. Aside from their loose connection through Harumi’s stepbrother, the only thing they share is their passion for music.

    After an awkward situation forces them to fake a romance, Xander and Harumi grow closer in ways they never anticipated. As secrets are revealed and the consequences of their fabricated relationship become clear, the line between fake dating and their real chemistry begins to blur. Soon, they are forced to confront a truth that frightens them both, leaving them to question what they truly mean to each other—and what they’re willing to risk to keep up the act.
